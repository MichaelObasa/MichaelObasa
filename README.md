**`DevOps Engineer`**

I'm a DevOps Engineer with a continuous desire to get better at what I do one day at a time. I build projects here that help develop my skills as a DevOps Engineer as well as use for examples by others looking to develop their skills. I have previously worked in the Telecoms and Fast Moving Consumer Goods for some of the largest companies in the world such as Virgin Media, Pepsi and Budweiser Brewing Group.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Michael's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I started my coding journey as someone who didn't have a traditional Computer Science background but was still hungry to learn all the tools I felt were relevant to solving real-world problems - SQL, Tableau, Python, Linux etc. Having obtained a Bachelors degree in Political Science, I initially began my career working in Private Equity as an Analyst and then in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Industry looking after Blue-Chip clients such as Amazon and Morrisons as a National Account Manager. However, whilst working there I felt something was missing - I had a desire to develop my programming knowledge, a desire which led me to pursue a career in DevOps Engineering.
</p>
I have since dedicated myself to continually learning key skills and practices that I believe will make me a great DevOps Engineer such as Linux Server Administration, Programming Fundamentals (Python and Bash), Networking Fundamentals, Security Fundamentals, Database Fundamentals (MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite), Cloud Fundamentals (IBM Cloud & AWS) aswell as Certification across IBM, AWS, Microsoft and GCP.
