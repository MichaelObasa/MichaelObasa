# 👋 Hey, I'm Michael Obasa  

**`DevOps Engineer | Cloud Automation | CI/CD | Building Reliable Systems`**

I’m a DevOps Engineer who enjoys building things that work and are simple, reliable, and automated.  
I focus on **cloud platforms, infrastructure as code, and CI/CD pipelines** that make it easy to build, test, and deploy software.  

I like using tools like **Terraform, Bicep, Docker, and Kubernetes** to manage cloud environments on **Azure** and **AWS**.  
Recently, I built a **multi-cloud Kubernetes project** that runs on both platforms, using **GitHub Actions** for automation.  

I’m also interested in how **AI and DevOps** connect - using automation, data, and MLOps to make systems smarter.  
Outside work, I’m building **Indexr**, an AI-powered crypto index fund platform, and **Draftley**, an AI writing co-pilot that helps students write faster and better.  

Before tech, I worked in sales, managing big accounts for brands like **Pepsi**, and **Budweiser**.  
That experience helps me understand users and build tools that solve real problems.  

Always learning. Always building. 
Drop me a message - I'm happy to connect

### 👨‍💻 My Journey

I didn’t start in tech.  
I studied **Political Science** and spent a few years in **B2B sales**, managing large accounts for companies like BT and Pepsi.  
That work taught me how to solve problems, communicate clearly, and stay focused on results - things I still use every day as an engineer.

When I switched to tech, I started small - learning scripting, cloud setup, and automation.  
Now, I build and manage full cloud systems using **Azure**, **AWS**, **Terraform**, and **Kubernetes**, with pipelines powered by **GitHub Actions** and **Jenkins**.  

I enjoy seeing how everything fits together - from code to infrastructure to end users.  
Whether I’m working on production systems or building my own tools, my goal is always the same:  
make things simpler, faster, and more reliable.
